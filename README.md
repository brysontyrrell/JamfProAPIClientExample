# Jamf Pro API Client Example

This is an example app that uses a Jamf Pro API client created by the [swift-openapi-generator](https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-generator).

This repo is a companion to this [blog post on dev.to](https://dev.to/brysontyrrell/using-the-swift-openapi-generator-for-the-jamf-pro-api-p2k/manage) if you want a full walkthrough of the code and setup process.

## Running the app

Clone this repository and open it in Xcode. The package dependencies should automatically install.

Open `ContentView.swift`. In the `ContentView` struct there is a `client` private var that takes the hostname, client ID, and client secret for a Jamf Pro instance. You will need to replace the placeholder `"..."` values with your own.

```swift
@State private var client = JamfProAPIClient(
    hostname: "...",
    clientID: "...",
    clientSecret: "..."
)
```
